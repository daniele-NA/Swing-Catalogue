This program allows you to insert cigarette packs, scale them and change prices. Furthermore, it saves all the information not in a database,
but in a local file created by the computer
with .CGR [bytecode] extension (modifiable by the database class) which is created if fully created and cast every time the program is opened.



TO USE THE PROGRAM WITH THE BARCODE GUN, MAKE SURE TO ACTIVATE THE "sale" MODE, using the appropriate button
